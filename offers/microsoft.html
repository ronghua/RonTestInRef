<b> About Microsoft's offer </b>

Rather, it is tied with the level you are offered. 
Generall, Microsoft's offer package is pretty standard.

<p>
Most likely, if you are fresh graduate, your package would look like: 
<ul>

  <li> For level 60, $105k + $55k + 10%
  <li> For level 61, $115k + $55k + 10%
 
</ul>
